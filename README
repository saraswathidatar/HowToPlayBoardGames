Introduction
How To Play Board Games is an android application which specifies rules that are used to play some of the popular board games such as chess, sequence, catan etc. As a prototype, I started with playing chess with Board Setup that helps user to setup a board, Pieces that list all the pieces of the game and when clicked on individual Piece describes its moves and special rules with suitable pictures and voice messages, Special rules for all the pieces of the game and Challenges set for the game. There are many How to learn chess apps in the market, my goal is to have rules for a consolidated set of board games(for which I haven't seen any app).

Project Status
1. Initially when I planned to scale the application by increasing the number of board games as I proceed, I realised that its a lot of options for a single game which consequently increases the number of tabs. Although I intend to provide a home button on every tab so that user can return to home page without having to navigate much, scaling seems to be cumbersome. So I am trying to work around that.
2. Text to Speech pronunciation needs to be improved.
3. Embedding videos is where I am facing some difficulty.
4. Also including some interesting challenges to play with is something I am not sure to include.
